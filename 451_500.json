Since the instances are in different regions, you typically cannot reference the US West instance's security group directly in the US East RDS security group rule. Therefore, the most straightforward method is to authorize the specific public IP address (or CIDR range) of the US West EC2 instance in the RDS security group's inbound rules. The correct option implies this by stating to configure the RDS security group for the US East EC2 group (which handles the local instance) and also to allow traffic originating from the US West instance's location, which would be done by its IP address."

You don't need to have an equal number of resources in every region. For users for whom a different region (e.g., Europe or Asia) provides the lowest latency, Route 53 would route them to an endpoint in that region. A single EC2 instance in another region is sufficient to serve as the endpoint for all users for whom that region is the lowest-latency option. The load on that single instance can be managed by its own scaling policies if necessary."
